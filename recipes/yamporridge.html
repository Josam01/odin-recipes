         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         
         <ul>
            <li>1 medium-sized yam (peeled and cut into cubes)</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons palm oil (or vegetable oil)</li>
             <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
             <li> 2 tomatoes (chopped) or 1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
              <li> 1 red bell pepper (blended)</li>
              <li>  1 scotch bonnet pepper (blended, optional for heat)</li>
              <li> 1/2 cup dried fish or smoked fish (optional)</li>
               <li>1/2 teaspoon ground crayfish (optional)</li>
               <li>2 cups water or stock</li>
               <li> Salt (to taste)</li>
               <li> Seasoning cubes (optional)</li>
               <li>Fresh spinach or ugu leaves (for garnish)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Preparations</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Prepare the yam: Peel and cut the yam into small cubes, rinse, and set aside.</li>

             <li>  Cook the base: Heat palm oil in a pot and sauté the chopped onions until soft. Add the blended peppers (bell pepper and scotch bonnet), tomatoes (or tomato sauce), and cook for about 5–7 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
                
              <li>  Add yam and liquid: Add the yam cubes to the pot, then pour in water or stock until the yam is just covered. Season with salt, seasoning cubes, and crayfish (if using). Stir well.</li>
                
              <li> Cook the yam: Cover the pot and let the yam cook for 15–20 minutes until it becomes tender. Stir occasionally to avoid sticking.</li>
                
              <li> Mash lightly: Once the yam is soft, mash some of the cubes with a spoon to thicken the porridge, but leave some pieces whole for texture.</li>
                
              <li>Add fish and greens: If using dried or smoked fish, add it now and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Stir in fresh spinach or ugu leaves as garnish.</li>
              
                
              <li> Serve: Your yam porridge is ready to be served hot!</li>
         </ol>
